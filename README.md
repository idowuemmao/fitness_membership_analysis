### **Key DAX Measures**

Some of the important DAX measures used:

```DAX
Total Revenue = SUM(fact_data[final_price])
Total Members = DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_data[member_id])
ARPM = [Total Revenue] / [Total Members]
Retention 30D = 
    DIVIDE(
        CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(fact_data[member_id]), fact_data[last_visit_date] >= TODAY()-30),
        [Total Members]
    )
Service Count = 
    (INT(fact_data[personal_training]) + INT(fact_data[attend_group_lesson]) 
    + INT(fact_data[uses_sauna]) + INT(fact_data[has_drink_subscription]))
```

---

### **Recommendations**

* **Upsell services**: Encourage single-service users to adopt at least one additional service.
* **Discount Strategy**: Optimize discount offerings â€” focus on loyalty discounts, reduce reliance on promos.
* **Churn Prevention**: Proactively target at-risk members in their first 3 months with engagement programs.
* **Access Optimization**: Reassess pricing for off-peak vs all-hour access to balance load and profitability.
* **Location Benchmarking**: Scale successful practices from high-performing gyms across weaker locations.

---

### **Tools & Techniques**

* **Data Prep:** Power Query for transformations, calculated columns for tenure, churn flags, and time extraction.
* **Modeling:** Star schema with supporting lookup tables (Date, Membership Type, Subscription Model, Discount Type, Gender, Location, Access Hours).
* **Visualization:** Combination of KPI cards, time series, bar/column charts, scatter plots, matrices, and funnels.
* **Interactivity:** Drill-throughs, synced slicers (Location, Membership, Date), and parameterized visuals.
